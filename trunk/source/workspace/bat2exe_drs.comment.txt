	Why Removed SRET/TRET?

L10
L11	Why PATH?

L26
L27	Why making the the Temp Path "absolute" %TEMP%?
	Better to keep it relative, dont care where it extracts itself.
	No need to use %CD%
	If someone has installed it in program files, then he shoud start it from there.
	if his version gets outdated, then there is no need use old files as core anymore.

L46	The Config variable defined, is already used by the .ini File

L61	Setting the variable to another variable, would keep it constant. (nat dynamically changed)

L88	using Hints is a good idea. this can be set by setting the Silent/Normal/Verbose Mode as a parameter while executing.
	These are the typical definitions used. the silent mode, doesn't echo anything. The Verbose mode shows every single action on the screen
	I would say the Welcome Message saying "This Tool..." belongs to the normal mode.

L106	passing the directory as a parameter is a nice feature, i would extend such parameters to define input and output directory and further options.
	example: -i="Path\to\Source\Folder" -o="Path\to\output\Folder" -s
	for example -i defines source and -s for silent or -v for verbose, maybe also -icon="path\to\icon.ico" and -run="path\to\batch\File.bat"
	or as alternative -config="Path\to\predefined\config.config" (which contains all previous settings)
	and so on..

L114	Sorry can't follow the target anymore..

L132	Nice Feature to let the user select his file if more than one has been found.
	I would pop up the File Browser in this case and let him select the file.
	If it should all stay inside the command window without GUI, them the muliple files, could be displayed in a list, like this:

	1:	file1.bat
	2:	file2.cmd
	3:	file3.bat
	
	Please type in the corresponding number of ur default file to run.
	(Here we can run the Choice Command and limit its options to the number of options above
	or use set /p method and verify the input afterwards.
	I have done a similar thing before. Here: http://www3.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/netz/fb15_Kabel.exe

L151	Nice to ask for name // alternatively I would think about making a simple run verion which doesn't require too much interaction and a prefessional version
	which asks for everything.. I dont know.

L161	Nice warning. Try the choice.exe command for this.

L207	What happens actually, when u delete the icon? I mean what Icon does it get at the end?
	May be we can just replace the current default icon by the bat2exe icon, as long as the user doesn't specify his custom icon

L250	No need to ask for user interaction, when we talk about icons.. either he defines an icon or he gets a default icon and thats it.
	He can be just prompted at the beginning if he wants to use an icon or not.

L266	Good to ask again for a .bat Folder
L327	instead of drag and drop, we can pop the browse.vbs, this is more user friendly.


And Finally, I would still keep the maximum error retries, then goto: bye
goto: thanks and good luck
exit
